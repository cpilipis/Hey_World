# Hey_World
My first github repo. Just to figure stuff out.
**Hi there. This is my first readme file!**
# Its cool.
I do not know how to write in markdown, but i can figure it out. Maybe i should [google](http:/www.google.com) it . . . 

I know how to write in _italicized_, and **bold**. What about _**both**_?

# Now i know how to:
* Mess with text's looks with Bold and Italics,
* Make Titles,
* Put links,
* And now, make lists.

I think that's all i need, right?
# **Wrong**.
 . . . Except as much as knowing more markdown would be helpful, I am just gonna stop here.
